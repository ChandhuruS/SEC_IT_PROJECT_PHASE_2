## DECODING RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANALYZING REVIEWS AND UNVEILING SENTIMENTS


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. It predicts whether a given review is positive or negative, helping restaurant owners understand customer sentiment and make data-driven decisions to improve their services.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification.
- Utilized CountVectorizer for text feature extraction.
- Developed a user-friendly interface using Gradio for real-time review sentiment analysis.
- Achieved high accuracy in sentiment prediction, enabling effective decision-making for restaurant management.

## Technologies used

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model trained on the Restaurant Reviews Dataset achieved high accuracy. This model enables accurate sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews, providing valuable insights into customer opinions. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed to facilitate real-time sentiment analysis.

- Enables restaurant owners to improve customer satisfaction and business performance.
- Empowers customers to make informed dining decisions based on sentiment analysis.
